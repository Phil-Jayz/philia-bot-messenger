# Build a Facebook Messenger  Bot with wit.ai and Node.js  In Just One Day

Chatbots are computer programs that mimic conversation with people through the use of artificial intelligence.
In a nutshell, when someone types in a message, the bot responds with the right reply.
Out of the thousands of chatbots that exist today, most are messenger apps designed to communicate with customers. They work with Natural Processing Language (NLP) systems which translate everyday language into a form that the bot can understand and learn new interactions from.

Through the help of that technology, bots now hold endless possibilities. You can use them to read everyday news, get the weather, transfer money, buy your favorite items, schedule a meeting, or even get service assistance. And all from the convenience of your favorite messenger app.

People are now spending more mobile screen time on messaging than on social media. A lot of companies have noticed the trend and are taking advantage of chatbots as a new channel to talk to us. Turns out that a whopping 60% of online adults in the US use online messaging, voice or video chat services.

***Today, I’m going to show you how to build your own Facebook Messenger bot using wit.ai and node.js.***
### A step-by-step guide to building the chatbot
#### What it does?
**PHILIA Recipe Engine** was originally an Alexa conversation skill, which provides more than 2 million indexed, standardized, and complete nutritional information recipes; so I decided to create a  facebook-messenger bot for this project as well. The bot allows searches by amount of nutrients, 40 diets and health labels, as well as keyword searches by type of cuisine (Chinese, Italian, Indian, French, ...), by type of meal (lunch, dinner, breakfast, snack) or by type of dish (soup, salad, pizza, sandwich, ...). 

#### Prerequisites
In order to start writing this bot application, there are a few requirements:
- [Facebook developer account](https://developers.facebook.com/)
- [Wit.ai](https://wit.ai/)
- [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Philia Recipe Engine API](https://api.philodi.com/alexa/)
- [Heroku account](https://www.heroku.com/)
- [Ngrok (local tunnel to your laptop for development purposes)](https://ngrok.com/)
- GNU Screen / Terminal

So, assuming we have all the above covered — Let’s get started!
**Step 1: Setting up your development environment**

1.**Writing webhook server with Restify**
First of all, we need to know that a webhook (also called a web callback or HTTP push API) is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information. It delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately, unlike typical APIs where you would need to poll for data very frequently in order to get it in real-time.
In order to get started, you will have to create a new directory, where you’ll store your entire project. We are going to name it “philia-bot-messenger”.
Once, you have created it, go to your terminal, access this directory and initialize your Node.js app with:
``` js
npm init
```
After filling out all the needed info (if you don’t know how to fill package.json, take a look [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json) ), your next step will be to install the required dependencies to setup our webhook server. So, in your terminal type:
``` js
npm install restify request --save
```
Once the installation is complete, go to your directory and create a file called index.js and start Restify server listening to the port 8001 (you can take any you want).
``` js
const Restify = require('restify')
let PORT = process.env.PORT || 8001;

const app = Restify.createServer({
    name: 'philia recipe engine'
})
app.use(Restify.plugins.bodyParser({ limit: '50mb' }))
app.use(Restify.plugins.jsonp())

app.listen(PORT, () =>
    console.log('Server listening on:' + PORT)
);
```
