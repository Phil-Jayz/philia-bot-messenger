## Build a Facebook Messenger  Bot with wit.ai and Node.js  In Just One Day

Chatbots are computer programs that mimic conversation with people through the use of artificial intelligence.
In a nutshell, when someone types in a message, the bot responds with the right reply.

Out of the thousands of chatbots that exist today, most are messenger apps designed to communicate with customers. They work with Natural Processing Language (NLP) systems which translate everyday language into a form that the bot can understand and learn new interactions from.
Through the help of that technology, bots now hold endless possibilities. You can use them to read everyday news, get the weather, transfer money, buy your favorite items, schedule a meeting, or even get service assistance. And all from the convenience of your favorite messenger app.

People are now spending more mobile screen time on messaging than on social media. A lot of companies have noticed the trend and are taking advantage of chatbots as a new channel to talk to us. Turns out that a whopping 60% of online adults in the US use online messaging, voice or video chat services.

***Today, Iâ€™m going to show you how to build your own Facebook Messenger bot using wit.ai and node.js.***
### A step-by-step guide to building the chatbot
#### What it does?
**PHILIA Recipe Engine** was originally an Alexa conversation skill, which provides more than 2 million indexed, standardized, and complete nutritional information recipes; so I decided to create a  facebook-messenger bot for this project as well. The bot allows searches by amount of nutrients, 40 diets and health labels, as well as keyword searches by type of cuisine (Chinese, Italian, Indian, French, ...), by type of meal (lunch, dinner, breakfast, snack) or by type of dish (soup, salad, pizza, sandwich, ...). 

#### Prerequisites
In order to start writing this bot application, there are a few requirements:
- Rust installed locally
- IDE setup for Rust development
- Discord account
